This project is a conceptual web-based dashboard designed to visualize and monitor application security threats. It simulates the detection and display of security-related events, such as potential SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, against web applications.

Key Features (as implemented in the code):

Threat Visualization: The dashboard displays key metrics like total active threats, high-severity threats, attacked applications, and vulnerability exploits.
Interactive Charts: It includes a timeline chart to show attack patterns over time and a pie chart to illustrate the distribution of different attack types.
Geographic Attack Origin (Placeholder): A placeholder is included for a map visualization to show where attacks originate.
Threat Log: A table provides a detailed log of individual threat events, including timestamp, application, severity, type, source IP, target URL, and description.
Simulated Data: The dashboard uses simulated log data and threat analysis for demonstration purposes.
Real-time Updates (Simulated): The dashboard simulates real-time updates by generating new fake logs and updating the display every 5 seconds.
Technical Highlights:

Frontend: HTML, CSS (Tailwind), and JavaScript.
Charting: Chart.js is used for creating the interactive charts.
Data Handling: JavaScript functions simulate log parsing, threat analysis, and data aggregation.
In essence, this project provides a basic framework for a security operations center (SOC) dashboard focused on application security. It demonstrates how security data can be visualized to provide insights into potential threats.
